  <p>Everyone who has been to Boston has gone to Mike's Pastry. Mike's Pastry is an incredible Italian bakery. They are known for their large amount of canolis which we highly recommend. Mike's Pastry is incredibly popular, easily the most famous bakery in Boston therefore, no matter what time of day there will always be a line outside Mike's Pastry. All three of us loves Mike's Pastry, all of the desserts are delicous and they are not too expensive. Desserts are about $3.50 each which is not too bad. Also it is important to know that the servings at Mike's Pastry are quite large so 2 people can easily share a dessert</p>
